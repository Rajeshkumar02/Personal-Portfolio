        <li>
          Our project's primary objective was to develop a web application that
          can detect fake reviews.
        </li>
        <li>
          To achieve this, we used a Machine Learning model that was trained on
          the Amazon review dataset from Kaggle.
        </li>
        <li>
          In addition to this dataset, we also collected data by allowing users
          to enter reviews into the app. We stored this data in Firebase
          Firestore, which allowed us to expand our dataset.
        </li>
        <li>
          To process the textual data from reviews, we implemented the{" "}
          <span className={`px-1 ${styles.highlight_txt}`}>TF-IDF</span>{" "}
          algorithm, which helps us extract meaningful features.
        </li>
        <li>
          We used{" "}
          <span className={`px-1 ${styles.highlight_txt}`}>
            Support Vector Machine (SVM)
          </span>{" "}
          as the Machine Learning model for the classification of reviews, as it
          is known for its high accuracy in classification tasks.
        </li>
        <li>
          For the front end of our web application, we used React.js to design a
          user-friendly interface that allows users to easily enter and view
          reviews.
        </li>
        <li>
          To handle the Machine Learning and database operations, we built a
          Flask-based backend that can communicate with our front end.
        </li>
        <li>
          We utilized Firebase Authentication to secure user data and restrict
          access to certain features of the web application.
        </li>
        <li>
          To ensure the accuracy of our model's predictions, we conducted
          extensive testing on both the Amazon review dataset and the data
          collected from our web application.
        </li>
        <li>
          Overall, our project represents a successful application of Machine
          Learning techniques to the problem of fake review detection, and we
          are proud of the results we have achieved.

      <p className={`fs-2 ${styles.sub_heading}`}>Introduction</p>
      <p className={`fs-5 ${styles.paragraph_txt}`}>
        In recent years, online reviews have become a vital part of the
        decision-making process for consumers. With the growth of e-commerce,
        people increasingly rely on online reviews to make informed decisions.
        However, not all online reviews are trustworthy. There are many fake
        reviews that mislead consumers and businesses alike. To tackle this
        problem, we have developed a machine learning-based solution to detect
        fake reviews.
      </p>
      <p className={`fs-2 ${styles.sub_heading}`}>Project Overview</p>
      <p className={`fs-5 ${styles.paragraph_txt}`}>
        Our project aims to use machine learning techniques to identify fake
        reviews and prevent their spread. To do this, we have used a combination
        of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms to analyze reviews
        and identify suspicious patterns. We have also used natural language
        processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the text of reviews and identify
        the underlying sentiment.
      </p>
      <p className={`fs-2 ${styles.sub_heading}`}>Dataset</p>
      <p className={`fs-5 ${styles.paragraph_txt}`}>
        To train our machine learning models, we have used a dataset of{" "}
        <span className={`px-1 ${styles.highlight_txt}`}>Amazon reviews</span>{" "}
        from Kaggle. This dataset contains thousands of reviews, both genuine
        and fake. We have used this dataset to train our models and evaluate
        their performance. We have also collected our own dataset by collecting
        the reviews users entered in our app and storing them in Firestore.
      </p>
      <p className={`fs-2 ${styles.sub_heading}`}>
        Machine Learning Techniques
      </p>
      <p className={`fs-5 ${styles.paragraph_txt}`}>
        We have used Support Vector Machines (SVM) as our primary classification
        algorithm. SVM is a powerful machine learning algorithm that is widely
        used for classification tasks. We have used SVM to train our models on
        the dataset and predict the authenticity of reviews.
      </p>
      <p className={`fs-2 ${styles.sub_heading}`}>
        Text Preprocessing using TF-IDF
      </p>
      <p className={`fs-5 ${styles.paragraph_txt}`}>
        To preprocess the text data, we have used the Term Frequency-Inverse
        Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technique. This technique is used to convert
        text data into a numerical representation that can be used by machine
        learning algorithms. We have used TF-IDF to extract features from the
        text data and prepare it for machine learning.
      </p>
      <p className={`fs-2 ${styles.sub_heading}`}>Backend using Flask</p>
      <p className={`fs-5 ${styles.paragraph_txt}`}>
        For the backend of our application, we have used Flask. Flask is a
        lightweight web application framework that is ideal for developing
        RESTful APIs. We have used Flask to develop a RESTful API that serves
        the predictions of our machine-learning models.
      </p>
      <p className={`fs-2 ${styles.sub_heading}`}>Frontend using ReactJS</p>
      <p className={`fs-5 ${styles.paragraph_txt}`}>
        For the front end of our application, we have used ReactJS. ReactJS is a
        popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We have used
        ReactJS to develop a user-friendly interface for our application that
        allows users to enter reviews and view the predictions of our
        machine-learning models.
      </p>
      <p className={`fs-2 ${styles.sub_heading}`}>Model Evaluation</p>
      <p className={`fs-5 ${styles.paragraph_txt}`}>
        Our machine-learning models have achieved high accuracy in detecting
        fake reviews. We have evaluated the performance of our models using
        metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score. Our models have
        achieved an F1 score of over 0.9, indicating that they are highly
        accurate in detecting fake reviews.
      </p>
      <p className={`fs-2 ${styles.sub_heading}`}>Sentiment Analysis</p>
      <p className={`fs-5 ${styles.paragraph_txt}`}>
        In addition to detecting fake reviews, our application also provides
        users with an analysis of the sentiment of their reviews. We have used
        NLP techniques to analyze the sentiment of reviews and provide users
        with an insight into the underlying sentiment of their reviews.
      </p>
      <p className={`fs-2 ${styles.sub_heading}`}>
        Real-time Monitoring System
      </p>
      <p className={`fs-5 ${styles.paragraph_txt}`}>
        We have also implemented a real-time monitoring system that detects the
        spread of fake reviews. This system continuously monitors the reviews
        and detects suspicious patterns in the data. If any suspicious activity
        is detected, the system alerts the users and takes appropriate action.
      </p>
      <p className={`fs-2 ${styles.sub_heading}`}>Comprehensive Solution</p>
      <p className={`fs-5 ${styles.paragraph_txt}`}>
        Overall, our project is a comprehensive solution to the problem of fake
        reviews. We have used machine learning techniques to detect fake
        reviews, analyze sentiment, and monitor the spread of fake reviews. Our
        solution is user-friendly and can be easily integrated into existing
        e-commerce platforms to improve the quality of online reviews.
      </p>
      <p className={`fs-2 ${styles.sub_heading}`}>Conclusion</p>
      <p className={`fs-5 ${styles.paragraph_txt}`}>
        In conclusion, fake reviews are a growing problem in the online world.
        With the help of machine learning techniques, we can detect fake reviews
        and prevent their spread. Our project is a step towards creating a more
        trustworthy online review system that benefits consumers and businesses.
